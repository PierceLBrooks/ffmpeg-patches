As of FFmpeg 3.2, there are issues that affect HTTP Live Streaming playback. The typical sympoms of this are:

1.  Playback works for 10-20 seconds and then pauses.
2.  After pausing for a long duration of time, another 10-20 seconds of video is played.

These patches are from forums on the internet and can be applied to solve some of these issues.
